# Candidates2020Resolucion
This project was made for the candidates 2020 of Roborregos team where I had to pass a maze, identify victims and send their coordinates, put out fires and turn, send landslide coordinates, and return to the base.
All the simulator mecanics was made by Roborregos and my resolution is in the main_program code
